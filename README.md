# tanstack-start

a minimal tanstack start project to test with the new framework. it uses vinxi, vite, and tanstack router under the hood. it is very minimal, has a few dependencies, and feels lightweight.

dx feels easier than nextjs or remix, feels more flexible and it is customizable.

it can be easily deployed to vercel. vercel approaches the project as a vite preset and deploys it without any problems. i haven't tested it with any docker images, but i have plans to do so.
